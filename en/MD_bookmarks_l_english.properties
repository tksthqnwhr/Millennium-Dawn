MODERN_DAY_NAME:=The World Today
MODERN_DAY_DESC:=Never has hunger been lower. Never have incomes been higher. Yet the world is marked by fear in the face of rapid social and technological change. The backlash to globalization is felt as the Middle East collapses into hybrid warfare and a wave of nationalist populism rolls over the West. The gravity of the world is shifting towards Asia, but the emerging powers of the world have yet to find an attractive alternative to the prevailing western world order.
USA_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=The United States, the world's sole superpower, faces a gradual decline in international power. Bogged down in Middle Eastern wars, government debt and the economic rise of China and other BRICS nations, American hegemony is not what it once was. However, due to its unique geographic position offering it total safety with no natural enemies, it can remain engaged overseas in force to defend both the US and it's allies' vital interests. At home, a wave of nationalist sentiment against both elitism and globalization has left it with it's most unlikely president ever - Donald Trump. \n\nWith European and Asian allies fearing both American unilateralism and a withdrawal from western liberal institutions, can the US strike a balance that will make the western world order prevail?
ENG_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=The United Kingdom sits in a position that any country has ever been in before. The 2016 Brexit referendum passed at fifty-one, nearly, fifty-two percent majority and it has become the first and only country to invoke Article 50 of the European Union. It will stand in the history books as either the greatest decision for the British people or the worst possible choice.\nDeal or no deal is the greatest question.
FRA_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=A global center of art, culture, and diplomacy, France looks brightly upon a new century brimming with hope and opportunity. The tyranny of the ancient monarchies and the destruction of the World Wars have hurtled France towards the European Union, of which it is a founding member. \n\nOnly time will tell how the French will tackle the century ahead.
GER_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=Through austerity and reforms, the German economy remained unscathed from the dual shocks of the 2008 financial crisis and the European debt crisis. As by far the strongest European economy, it has fallen on the once careful and unwilling Germany to lead the European Union forward in the face of Brexit and increased calls for national sovereignty. For Germany, the existence of the Eurozone and European Union is not a choice, but a necessity. European integration has produced a combined market large enough for its goods, as the strong German industrial sector has long since outstripped its internal demands. Furthermore, with a downward demographic trend, Germany must rely on increased immigration to fill the vacuum - a choice that is sure to be controversial with nationalism on the rise.
JAP_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=Japan is one of the world’s largest economies. It continues to outproduce many countries in Europe, and it also maintains one of the world’s most unique cultures. However, this large economy is plagued by incredible amounts of debt. The population of Japan and government is trending to around two hundred and forty-nine percent of its GDP. Furthermore, it is also one of few countries that is affected by an inverted population pyramid where the majority of its population is well over their forties.\nWill Japan collapse under its financial debt and population crisis or will it stand the test of time and become one of the strongest countries in the world?
SOV_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=The fall of the Soviet Union reversed 300 years of Russian expansionism and left the new federation with its 17th Century borders. The expansion of NATO into Eastern Europe and post-Soviet states has left it vulnerable, as it's heartland lies on the European plain - which is indefensible. Thus, gaining indirect control over post-Soviet states such as Ukraine, Georgia and the Baltics via initiatives such as the Eurasian Union is paramount if Russia is to ever again amount to anything more than a regional power with a decent military. Economically, she must overcome the dual shocks of low oil prices and western sanctions, and somehow tackle the rampant corruption in Russia's highly centralized bureaucracy.
CHI_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=China's geography - surrounded by mountains and jungles - protects it, but also isolates it from the rest of the world. As a multi-ethnic empire with large minorities, just maintaining it's territorial integrity takes considerable effort, as it needs to provide massive investments in its hinterlands and disputed territories in order to maintain control. It's perhaps largest vulnerability, however, is its dependence on exports and trade on the open ocean - which is controlled by the United States and its Asian-Pacific allies. For China to become a true superpower, it needs to compete with the US Navy in size and quality and to turn current Asian rivals into allies. China's diplomacy is hampered by its lack of an attractive political model. However, it is boosted by its massive foreign reserves and its willingness to use them to invest abroad.
BRA_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=Brazil is slowly on the rise at the turn of the century. The country has the potential for greatness. It is one of the world's largest emerging economies and its growth has continued to accelerate. However, in recent years Brazil's economic current is reeling back from a harsh recession due to the Asian Finanical Crisis of 1995 and a crippled currency. Now a new party contender has arrived on the scene. The PT has swopped in and is quickly gaining traction.\n\nWill you be able to kickstart the country's once great economy or will the PT and its socialist policies seize hold?\n\n Note: The Tree is Currently WIP and only has one playable path.
CAN_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=
UKR_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=The year 2014 made Ukraine the epicenter of events that could at any time lead to irreversible consequences. The dignity revolution overthrew Viktor Yanukovich’s authoritarian power and brought a new pro-Western government headed by Petro Poroshenko. Despite many campaign promises, the newly elected guarantor led the country into an even bigger debt trap and took advantage of the situation for its benefit. The people's patience is running out. The Crimean peninsula was annexed by our former friends, and the eastern regions of Donbas are swept up by the flames of war. Only a few years are left before the new elections, but will the people endure until the end of the presidential term?
TUR_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=Recent years haven't been forgiving. Although PKK threat has been nearly eliminated, we couldn't come up with a solution to end it fully. It has been mere months since the coup attempt has been repelled and although some people even starting to forget it, some perpetrators are still at large, few of them still inside our country, some has been hiding abroad or being sheltered by our enemies, including, the head of the snake, Fethullah Gülen. And all the while some circles have been circulating rumors that Erdogan himself orchestrated the coup and made it fail in purpose to get rid of opposition and seize more power. Nonetheless, a portion of people that got purged have turned out to be innocent and these mistaken convictions are proven.
SYR_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=With divided loyalties in the Syrian Armed Forces and staggering losses from 6 years of fighting a brutal civil war, the regular Army is a spent force. Its place on the Syrian battlefield has been taken by wide array of militias, private military companies, Hezbollah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, who together have begun to reverse Assad's losses. However, with its economy destroyed, and most of Syria's territory under the control of terrorists, rebels and Kurds, the prospect of a united Syria looks certain to be a long struggle ahead.
SYR_2000_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=Syria has been under the dictatorship of the al-Assad family since 1971. Hafez al-Assad's health is currently failing, and soon a new successor will rise. Many of Hafez's children and relatives are vying for power but only one can rule.
FSA_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=Initially the Free Syrian Army was a umbrella-organization of anti-Assad rebel groups and a true government in parallel. However, radicalization of Syrian militants led to mass defections to both Al-Qaeda ally Al-Nusra and ISIS, contributing to the eradication of the FSA in the north of Syria. As a result, the Free Syrian Army was dismantled as an organization. However, a wide array of Muslim Brotherhood linked rebel groups together with smatterings of salafists and secular groups still retain the label. In the South of Syria, FSA-affiliated groups have been successful in desert warfare against ISIS, and still defend most of Dara'a from Assad's forces. In the north, the Turkish Army intervention has been successful in creating a wedge between the two Kurdish cantons.
NUS_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=In January of 2017 multiple Mujahideen factions united under the call to a unified Jihad against the tyrant Al-Assad. Known as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or the Levant Liberation Committee, this formidable organization was formed in the bloodshed of the Syrian civil war. The group is classified by the U.S.A as a terrorist organization and an al-Qaeda affiliated organization.
ROJ_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=As the Syrian Civil War began, Assad's forces withdrew from the Kurdish areas to defend its heartland. This allowed the long repressed Kurdish people, through the left-wing Democratic Union Party and it's militia, the YPG, to take control and establish Rojava, based on democratic socialism and gender equality. As ISIS entered the Syrian battlefield, they targeted the Kurds with force, taking over large swaths of Rojava, culminating in the failed assault on Kobane. With reinforcements from the Peshmerga, the Turkish PKK and US air support, the Kurds were able to turn the tide and send ISIS on the run. Since then, it has incorporated parts of the old FSA under the banner of the "SDF". However, it's future challenges remain numerous, with Turkey repeatedly threatening war and fears looming that the tacit alliance with Assad might break down into conflict.
OTHER_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world.
DEN_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=Denmark is a safe and secure nation, being both a member of the EU and NATO. However, an internal economic downturn and slowdown has recently begun challenging the Danish state. Whether Denmark can continue to remain immune from the turbulence of the wider world is far from certain.
ETH_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=Ethiopia's monarchy was overthrown in 1974 and its subsequent communist dictatorship in 1991. The constitution of 1995 has provided a somewhat stable democracy, but it has failed to address the problems of starvation, political crisis and corruption.
FIN_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=Ever concerned with preserving its neutrality, Finland has carefully watched the Soviet Union's collapse and the subsequent political expansion of the western European integrationist project. The Finns joined the EU in 1995 and has also adopted the Euro as the national currency. Can peace last? Are the Russians truly pacified?
ITA_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=Italy has been ever so slightly behind the other Great Powers since the beginning of the 20th Century. After its defeat in World War Two, Italy's strong bond to its former enemies and its former ally in Germany has brought it back up to the status of a highly developed and prosperous country. But what will the future hold? National greatness or economic disaster?
NOR_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=Norway voted against joining the European Union in 1995 and has subsequently stayed distant from Europe to a certain extent. Nonetheless, the country remains a NATO member and shares a short but critical border with the Russian Federation, a powerful neighbor that it must necessarily be wary of.
SWE_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=Sweden had been in a deep economic crisis in the early 1990s, with the country's EU accession in 1995 doing little to alleviate its issues. The Swedish nation, which stays militarily neutral as is Swedish tradition, has to find economic answers to its current troubles.
POL_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=Poland has grown massively since its arrival to the European Union in 2004. It is now a regional power and one of the fastest growing economies in Europe. It is on course to become one of the most significant powers in Europe. Poland's current political situation is an interesting one as PiS has gotten into power and relations with the EU have gotten heated. A staunchly anti-Russian country, Poland has made a large effort into strengthening its relations with the United States.
SWI_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=Neutral since time immemorial, Switzerland has decided to stay out of both NATO and the European Union. Can the international community still rely on Switzerland to be the silent judge and the neutral ground it has always been? Or will the Swiss people see their government take a more active role abroad to preserve peace and enforce Swiss national interests?
BRM_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=Aung Saan Suu Kyi, once the darling of the international community, has seen a dramatic reversal of fortunes in terms of international public opinion. No longer the charismatic and eloquent human rights campaigner, the Rohingya Crisis has transformed Myanmar's de facto leader into a villified war criminal in the eyes of many. Within the country's territorial boundaries, rebel groups and still powerful military generals watch for signs of weakness. These twin dilemmas, international and domestic, present the government of Myanmar with important choices. Permit or halt the violence against the Muslims of Rakhine. Attempt to restore relations with the West, or fall back on the military junta's old ally, China. The answer is far from clear.
NIG_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=Nigeria's last ten years have shown the true colors of the Islamic State as it supports the major uprising of Boko Haram and the Salafist rebels in the North East of Nigeria. The military of Nigeria proved incredibly ineffective at fighting in the new kind of guerilla warfare. It has slowly grown into a major regional conflict as the Nigerian government is slowly losing more and more control over of the state of Borno.\n Will you end the insurgency or join the global jihad?
BHR_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=Bahrain is a nation that did not escape the wave of protests that spread throughout the Middle East as part of the so-called "Arab Spring". The Day of Rage saw the Shi'a majority vent its frustration against a monarchy that is perceived not only as discriminatory towards the Shi'a but also as a foreign occupier and an oppressor of the true, indigenous Bahraini people. Without the intervention of Peninsula Shield, the monarchy may well have collapsed in 2011.\n\nThe Khalifa dynasty's priority is therefore the preservation of its rule in the face of Shi'a hostility. While historically the Sunni opposition posed a greater threat, the specter of Iranian influence and limited political liberalization mean that this threat has been subdued, at least for now.
KUW_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=Kuwait enjoys a relatively comfortable position internationally. The greatest threat to its sovereignty, Saddam Hussein's Iraq, was eliminated by the American invasion of 2003, and Kuwait has managed to maintain good relations with all of the Middle East's regional players.\n\nKuwait's biggest challenge, although not an urgent one, is internal in nature. The country's system of semi-democratic rule has bolstered the government's legitimacy but has prevented the reforms necessary to diversify Kuwait's oil-dependent economy. Moreover, Kuwait's reforms have not completely placated the opposition, who continue to oppose government censorship and the occasional repression of political activists.
OMA_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=Oman has earned a reputation as a beacon of peace and stability in a restless and conflict-prone region. Qaboos bin Said al Said has pursued a successful foreign policy since he took power in 1970, leading a country that is hated by none and admired by all. But Oman is not without its challenges. The Sultan has been criticized for his heavy-handed approach towards internal dissent, raising uncertainty about the sustainability of the absolute monarchy. Moreover, the war in Yemen has opened up a new threat. Oman has historically considered the Yemeni province of al-Mahra part of its sphere of influence, given the region's close cultural links to Dhofar in Oman. But the presence of Saudi troops threatens Oman's border and will not be tolerated by the Omani state, even if it means secretly undermining the Saudi war effort.
QAT_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=Since 1996 Qatar has charted an independent course within the Gulf Cooperation Council. The country's natural gas reserves has allowed Qatar to operate outside of the Saudi-dominated oil market, and for decades the emirs of Qatar have enjoyed a close relationship to the populist Muslim Brotherhood, an organization that the Saudis and Emiratis have increasingly come to see as a threat to their authority. As the home of Al-Jazeera, Qatar is partially blamed by the other Arab autocracies for the spread of the Arab uprisings collectively known as the Arab Spring. Worst of all in the eyes of the Saudis and their Emirati allies is Qatar's close relationship with Iran, a state that they view as an existential threat. It is only a matter of time before the hostility of Qatar's neighbors to its unique foreign policy reaches boiling point.
SAU_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=The Saudis have watched as the Middle East was irrevocably transformed by a series of momentous events. First the events of 2003 eliminated a major player in the power struggle between Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran and inflamed sectarian tensions between Sunni and Shi'a as a result of the subsequent civil war. Then the Saudis watched in horror as friendly regimes across the Arab world were toppled by the phenomenon known as the Arab Spring. And finally, the Saudis anxiously observed America's gradual withdrawal from the region and its rapprochement with Iran under Obama. All this has convinced the Saudis of the need for a more proactive foreign policy, one that has led the monarchy to aggressively counter Iranian influence across the Middle East. From Lebanon to Yemen, from Syria to Iraq, battle lines are being drawn.
UAE_MODERN_DAY_DESC:=Fondly nicknamed by American officials as "Little Sparta", the United Arab Emirates has been a close ally to both the United States and Saudi Arabia and an eager participant in multilateral military operations. The Emirati armed forces, particularly its reputable air force and its elite Presidential Guard, has seen service in Afghanistan, Libya, Kosovo, Somalia and now Yemen. But the UAE is not content to simply play second fiddle to the US or Saudi Arabia. The Emiratis have punched above their weight in terms of foreign influence, at times competing with its erstwhile allies for example by throwing its weight behind separatists in Yemen temporarily allied to the Saudi-backed Hadi government. Moreover, the UAE is home to the only successful case of economic diversification, Dubai having earned a reputation as a global city and a financial hub.

MILLENNIUM_DAWN:=Millennium Dawn
MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=The world has changed. Globally speaking, an atmosphere of peace and prosperity has ruled for about half a century. But with the recent end of the Cold War and the rise of the People's Republic of China, how will this world see itself? How will it shape itself? Will the United States continue its dominance? Will the new Russian Federation find its way into the spotlight? What roles will the former great European empires of Britain, France and Germany play? And what role will the shadow of terrorism have? The world has changed. The world is changing.
CHI_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=The backwater of yesterday. The superpower of tomorrow. After decades of European bullying and even more decades of civil war, strife, and invasion by the Japanese, China looks to rebuild itself as the foremost power of Asia, and eventually, the world. \n\nUnder the leadership of the Communist Party, great strides have been made in building a new China. But this new China is volatile. If China reforms too slowly; it may be destroyed. If it reforms too quickly; it might destroy itself.
FRA_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=A global center of art, culture, and diplomacy, France looks brightly upon a new century brimming with hope and opportunity. The tyranny of the ancient monarchies and the destruction of the World Wars have hurtled France towards the European Union, of which it is a founding member. \n\nOnly time will tell how the French will tackle the century ahead.
GER_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=The retreat of the Soviets and the reunification of East and West Germany have given new hope to the nation. Germany’s traumatic past and the horrors of fascism have not been lost on the general populace. Now, Germany stands as one of the most democratic nations in Europe, with a robust social welfare system and one of the strongest economies in Europe. \n\nA founding member of the European Union, Germany looks towards expanding the bloc to include the former Soviet states of Eastern Europe against a possible Russian resurgence.
JAP_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=A land of roughly 6,852 islands, the maritime people of Japan have come far since the Second World War and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Today, Japan stands as the second-largest economy on Earth, renowned for its technological innovation and quality products shipped across the world. \n\nBacked by its American and European allies, Japan looks warily at its old rival China with both newfound confidence and new potential for conflict.
SOV_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=The August Coup and subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 has left the Russian economy in tatters, its pride shaken, and its future looking grim. Oligarchs and corrupt officials have filled the vacuum of power in the absence of a strong central authority. \n\nThe recent rise of Vladimir Putin has many wondering how this ex-KGB officer will attempt to restore Russia’s legacy and bring it forward into a new age.
ENG_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=With Hong Kong handed over to China in 1997, the United Kingdom has bid farewell to its last great colonial possession. The once mightiest nation on Earth is desperately trying to redefine itself and find a new path to greatness and glory. \n\nWill that path lie in continued cooperation with the United States? Should Britain draw closer to its European brethren? Or shall Britannia, on her own, rule the waves once more?
USA_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=The collapse of the Soviet Union has led to the world’s first unipolar moment. The United States stands at the forefront of all technological, military, and cultural forces at work across the globe. Its reach has never been greater, and its future has never looked brighter. \n\nThe upcoming elections will prove a crucial moment in determining the future course of America; and for better or worse, the world.
TUR_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=Since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War One, Turkey has largely remained in the backdrop of geopolitical affairs. Now, Turkey’s position puts it in the spotlight once again, as competing ideologies work to shift the country one way or the other. \n\nShould the Republic continue with Atatürk's reforms and seek recognition with the EU, or remain true to its Islamic heritage? The failing health of Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit signals uncertain times ahead.
UKR_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=The elections of 1999 were supposed to bring an unconditional victory to the liberal leader of the National Movement - Viacheslav Chornovil. But soon, he died in a car accident under mysterious circumstances. The current president, Leonid Kuchma, won the election in the wake of truthful slogans and lack of populist promises. But what his cadence will bring is still questionable. \n\nAfter being deprived of its nuclear status in 1996 and signing the Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine received guarantees of protection from the strongest states and a ticket to the world theater. But who will the young country be at the future performance? A direct participant or merely an observer in the last rows?
BRA_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=Brazil is slowly on the rise at the turn of the century. The country has the potential for greatness. It is one of the world's largest emerging economies and its growth has continued to accelerate. However, in recent years Brazil's economic current is reeling back from a harsh recession due to the Asian Finanical Crisis of 1995 and a crippled currency. Now a new party contender has arrived on the scene. The PT has swopped in and is quickly gaining traction.\n\nWill you be able to kickstart the country's once great economy or will the PT and its socialist policies seize hold?\n\n Note: The Tree is Currently WIP and only has one playable path.

DEN_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=Denmark is a safe and secure nation, being both a member of the EU and NATO. However, an internal economic downturn and slowdown has recently begun challenging the Danish state. Whether Denmark can continue to remain immune from the turbulence of the wider world is far from certain.

The constitution of 1995 has provided a somewhat stable democracy, but it has failed to address the problems of starvation, political crisis and corruption. It has also not resolved Ethiopia's ongoing conflict with Eritrea.
FIN_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=Ever concerned with preserving its neutrality, Finland has carefully watched the Soviet Union's collapse and the subsequent political expansion of the western European forces. The Finns joined the EU in 1995 and is about to adopt the Euro as the national currency. Can peace last? Are the Russians truly pacified?
ICE_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=In a hidden corner of Europe, Iceland has successfully kept a low profile since independence in 1944. Political conflicts with the British about fishing rights were perhaps the most exciting time in Icelandic history. Should Iceland take a more central stance?
ITA_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=Italy has been ever so slightly behind the other Great Powers since the beginning of the 20th Century. After its defeat in World War Two, Italy's strong bond to its former enemies and its former ally in Germany has brought it back up to the status of a highly developed and prosperous country. But what will the future hold? National greatness or economic disaster?
NOR_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=Norway voted against joining the European Union in 1995 and has subsequently stayed distant from Europe to a certain extent. Nonetheless, the country remains a NATO member and shares a short but critical border with the Russian Federation, a powerful neighbor that it must necessarily be wary of.
RAJ_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=Where China is the superpower of tomorrow, India is the superpower of next week. Its constant struggles against Pakistan and China as well as its deep economic connection to the west have given India a niche to prosper. If it is given enough time, the Tiger of South Asia will be strong enough to take out every single one of its enemies.
SPR_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=Since Franco's death in 1975, Spain has been on a long path of recovery. Through economic and social hardship, the country managed to partially work through the issues that decades of falangism had caused. Spain joined NATO (1982) and the EU (1986) and has tirelessly and under the greatest of efforts worked to catch up to the more powerful and wealthy major countries of Europe; to Germany, France, Britain, and Italy.\nIn times like these, Spain requires strong leadership and a stable hand. Can Prime Minister Aznar deliver? Or will his Partido Popular make place for a more worthy leadership?
SWE_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=Sweden had been in a deep economic crisis in the early 1990s, with the country's EU accession in 1995 doing little to alleviate its issues. The Swedish nation, which stays militarily neutral as is Swedish tradition, has to find economic answers to its current troubles.
SWI_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=Neutral since time immemorial, Switzerland has decided to stay out of not only NATO and the European Union, but also even the United Nations. Can the international community still rely on Switzerland to be the silent judge and the neutral ground it has always been? Or will the Swiss people see their government take a more active role abroad to preserve peace and enforce Swiss national interests?
BRM_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=Myanmar stands at a crossroads at the start of the 21st century. The military junta has come to realize that its grip on power is steadily loosening, as pressure from both within and without to democratize grows ever stronger. However, democratization or lack thereof is not the only issue before Myanmar's government. The territorial integrity of this Southeast Asian nation has been shaky ever since independence, with rebel groups fighting for greater autonomy plaguing Myanmar's border regions. The solutions to these twin dilemmas remain unclear. Violence or diplomacy? Democracy or authoritarianism? Compromise or revolution? Only time will tell.
POL_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=Poland has recently broken free from the communist bloc of the Soviet Union. The current situation in the country is far from perfect. Despite the growth of the Polish economy since the fall of communism, the people of Poland continue to struggle. Despite these difficulties, the nation itself has a lot of potential to become a significant economic power. The future looks bright for Poland.
NIG_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=Nigeria at the turn of the century has slowly gained international primacy as its large population and bankers continue to expand their hold in foreign markets. Furthermore, they have begun to participate more in the local region as their newfound liberal democracy has started to grow in popularity. However, Nigerian democracy is now strained by the emergence of Sharia Law in its northern states, threatening the stability of the nation. Outrage and protests have exploded amongst the Christian populace. \nWill the growing popularity of Islam cause war in the country?
BHR_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=The newly crowned emir of Bahrain, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, inherits a precarious position. Bahrain's Shi'a majority harbors significant frustration towards a monarchy that is perceived not only as discriminatory towards the Shi'a but also as a foreign occupier and an oppressor of the true, indigenous Bahraini people. The Sunni opposition, for albeit different reasons, resents the autocratic nature of Bahraini government, and has aligned itself with Shi'a groups opposed to a continuation of the absolute monarchy. Some of the emir's advisors have pushed for political liberalization as a way to reduce the pressure placed on the regime, while others have advocated a strengthening of autocratic rule. It will be up to Bahrain's new ruler to chart a course for the country.
KUW_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=Not too long ago Kuwait was a country under occupation. Its monarchy was in exile campaigning for a restoration of Kuwaiti sovereignty, while the people of Kuwait, both Sunni and Shi'a, were united against the Iraqi oppressor. Now that the Gulf War has restored Kuwaiti independence, the monarchy must resume the political balancing act that is ruling the nation of Kuwait. Kuwait's parliament, one of the most powerful in the Middle East, places a powerful check on the monarch's authority while continually pressing for greater political liberalization. The country's influential merchant class continues to push for greater investment in the private sector, something that public sector-employed Kuwaiti citizens are reluctant to see happen at the expense of their own welfare.
OMA_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=Oman has earned a reputation as a beacon of peace and stability in a restless and conflict-prone region. Qaboos bin Said al Said has pursued a successful foreign policy since he took power in 1970, leading a country that is hated by none and admired by all. But Oman is not without its challenges.

It is only a matter of time before the hostility of Qatar's neighbors to its unique foreign policy reaches boiling point.
SAU_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=Saudi Arabia has historically enjoyed a comfortable position as one of the Middle East's leading powers. As custodian of the holy sites of Mecca and Medina, the Kingdom enjoys unparalleled religious legitimacy. However, the Iranian Revolution of 1979 transformed mutual Saudi-Iranian suspicion into outright hostility as the newly formed Islamic Republic of Iran sought to claim the mantle of leader of the Islamic world. Internally too the Kingdom faces challengers for the title of leader of the Islamic world. Since the Saudis allowed American troops into the country in 1991, the al-Qaeda leadership has sworn to destroy the Saudi monarchy and its false piety and replace it with a truly Islamic government.
UAE_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=Fondly nicknamed by American officials as "Little Sparta", the United Arab Emirates has been a close ally to both the United States and Saudi Arabia and an eager participant in multilateral military operations.

Moreover, the UAE is home to the only successful case of economic diversification, Dubai having earned a reputation as a global city and a financial hub.
OTHER_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=World War One, World War Two, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan. The wars of the past have left the nations of the present fearing for the future. However, there is great hope that humanity might have passed 20 centuries of bloodshed to complete its transition to a period of peace and stability.
OTHER_MILLENNIUM_DAWN_DESC:=World War One, World War Two, Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan. The wars of the past have left the nations of the present fearing for the future.
